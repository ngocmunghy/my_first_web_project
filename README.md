## Getting started

1. Make sure you've installed `WAMP`,`LAMP`or`XAMPP` on your system.
If you don't have any of these on your system, then download it from:
* [WAMPSEVERSER](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) 
* [LAMPSERVER](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer) 
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) ( I'm using this )
